# Lord Of The Rings
I love The Lord Of The Rings. So, I created with a lot of love this ReactJR app using an API of the movies and books.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!

## What you can do:
- Find your favourite characters!
- See The Lord Of The Rings books and its chapters!
- See quotes from the characters randomly!
- Finally, enjoy an immersion into this legendarium!

## How to use it:
1. Download the latest release
2. Unzip the files
3. Open the Console/Terminal
4. Access the directory of the project "lordoftherings"
5. Run the command:
```
$ npm i react-bootstrap react-bootstrap-icons react-paginate
```
